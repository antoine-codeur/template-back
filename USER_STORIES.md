## 📋 Implementation Notes

### Priority Levels
1. **P0 (Critical)** - Essential for MVP launch
2. **P1 (High)** - Important for user experience
3. **P2 (Medium)** - Nice to have features
4. **P3 (Low)** - Future enhancements

### Acceptance Criteria Template
For each user story, include:
- **Given** - Initial context/preconditions
- **When** - Action taken by the user
- **Then** - Expected outcome/result
- **Acceptance Tests** - Specific test cases to validate

### Dependencies
- Some user stories depend on others being completed first
- Cross-reference related stories when implementing
- Consider technical dependencies (auth before protected features)
